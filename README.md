## Developer Reference ##

There are a number of filter hooks that can be used to modify the plugin to suit your needs. By default, this plugin was built to pull GitHub releases, specifically. but this can be changed to any API endpoint the GitHub API provides, or, potentially, pull updates from any public API.

### `dc.api_expiration`
Filters the cache expiration time.

API requests are filtered using `wp_cache_set` and `wp_cache_get` so we are making as few hits to the API as possible. By default, cached data from the API is stored for 1 day. You can filter this to whatever length you would prefer.

#### Parameters

**`$expire`** _(int)_ The length to retain cached response codes.

### `dc.api.url`
The API URL

By default, this is `https://api.github.com/repos`, the GitHub API endpoint for repositories, specifically. If you want to use a completely different API, you can filter this variable.

#### Parameters
**`$base_url`** _(string)_ The API URL to filter.

### `dc.widget.max_display`
The number of updates to display.

By default, we display 3 updates (releases) from the API, but this can be updates here.

#### Parameters
**`$max_display`** _(int)_ The number of release updates to display.
